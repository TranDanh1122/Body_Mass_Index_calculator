  What your BMI result means

  A BMI range of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered a 'healthy weight.' Maintaining a
  healthy weight may lower your chances of experiencing health issues later on,
  such as obesity and type 2 diabetes. Aim for a nutritious diet with reduced
  fat and sugar content, incorporating ample fruits and vegetables. Additionally,
  strive for regular physical activity, ideally about 30 minutes daily for
  five days a week.

  Healthy eating
  Healthy eating promotes weight control, disease prevention, better digestion,
  immunity, mental clarity, and mood.

  Regular exercise
  Exercise improves fitness, aids weight control, elevates mood, and reduces disease
  risk, fostering wellness and longevity.

  Adequate sleep
  Sleep enhances mental clarity, emotional stability, and physical wellness, promoting
  overall restoration and rejuvenation.

  Limitations of BMI

  Although BMI is often a practical indicator of healthy weight, it is not suited for
  every person. Specific groups should carefully consider their BMI outcomes, and in
  certain cases, the measurement may not be beneficial to use.

  Gender
  The development and body fat composition of girls and boys vary with age. Consequently,
  a child's age and gender are considered when evaluating their BMI.

  Age
  In aging individuals, increased body fat and muscle loss may cause BMI to underestimate
  body fat content.

  Muscle
  BMI may misclassify muscular individuals as overweight or obese, as it doesn't
  differentiate muscle from fat.

  Pregnancy
  Expectant mothers experience weight gain due to their growing baby. Maintaining a
  healthy pre-pregnancy BMI is advisable to minimise health risks for both mother
  and child.

  Race
  Certain health concerns may affect individuals of some Black and Asian origins at
  lower BMIs than others. To learn more, it is advised to discuss this with your
  GP or practice nurse.
